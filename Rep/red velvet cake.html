            Red velvet cake is much more than <em>vanilla</em> cake tinted red.
            This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with superior buttery,
            vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from
            buttermilk. My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a
            smooth velvet crumb.

            <strong>Cake flour: </strong> Buttermilk is tangy, creamy, and makes
            baked goods extremely moist. You can’t make delicious red velvet
            cake without it! Additionally, buttermilk helps activate the baking
            soda to leaven the cake. Buttermilk: Buttermilk is tangy, creamy,

            flour is much lighter than all-purpose and the perfect base for a
            light, soft-crumbed cake texture. Like I mention above, red velvet’s
            texture is important to the authenticity of the flavor. You will
            thank me for the recommendation after you taste how incredibly soft
            this cake is. It’s the texture you find at professional bakeries.

            <strong>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder:</strong> 2 Tablespoons is plenty
            for a little cocoa flavor without overpowering the vanilla and
            butter flavors.

          <li>
            <strong>Butter & Oil:</strong> What sets red velvet cake apart from
            chocolate is its buttery flavor. With only butter, we risk a dry
            cake. With only oil, we lose the butter flavor and softness that
            comes with creaming butter & sugar together. So all that’s to say,
            use both butter and oil. Moist texture, soft and cakey texture,
            buttery flavor.
