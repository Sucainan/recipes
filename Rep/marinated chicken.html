        <h2>Ingrediant</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            extra virgin olive oil – this is the base of the marinade and keeps
            the chicken so juicy and moist.
          </li>
          <li>
            balsamic vinegar – a balsamic chicken marinade is my very favorite.
            It is definitely one of the key ingredients in this recipe and adds
            loads of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>soy sauce – I like to use low sodium.</li>
          <li>
            Worcestershire sauce – so many flavor in this ingredient, it’s a
            must for this marinade.
          </li>
          <li>
            lemon juice – fresh is best for flavor but you can use bottled if
            you need to.
          </li>
          <li>
            brown sugar – I have lots of readers that reduce or even eliminate
            the brown sugar but I personally love it in this recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            dried rosemary – a little herbaceous flavor is always nice to round
            out a marinade.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dijon mustard – or Spicy Brown mustard or even plain yellow mustard
            will work in a pinch.
          </li>
          <li>salt and ground black pepper – for seasoning.</li>
          <li>
            garlic powder – I prefer garlic powder instead of fresh garlic
            because the fresh garlic will burn on the grill.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare marinade. Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and
            whisk together. Cheater method: put them straight into a large
            ziploc bag that will also be used for marinating the chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reserve. Remove a half a cup of marinade and reserve for basting the
            chicken later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Marinate Chicken. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag
            and pour marinade over the top. Close securely and gently massage
            marinade into breasts. Marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24
            hours.
          </li>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>
          If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish
          towel for protection, and use it to press down on the spatula with
          both hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), but I
          prefer the thinner patties that have more crispy surface area.
        </p>

        <p>
          I buy American cheese freshly-sliced from the deli, but
          individually-wrapped slices will work too.
