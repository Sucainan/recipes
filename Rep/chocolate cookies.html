        <h1>chocolate Cookies</h1>
        <p>
          The best recipe for <em>double chocolate chip cookies</em> must
          obviously include extra doses of chocolate. These soft-baked thick and
          chunky cookies are as indulgent as they look: rich and fudge-like with
          chewy centers, slightly crisp edges, and oodles of melty chocolate
          chips in each glorious bite.

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>
          The dough definitely comes together easily, but it’s sticky and tacky
          as a result of the cocoa powder mixing with liquid. It’s even stickier
          than the chocolate layer of pinwheel cookies. Therefore, the dough
          requires chilling before you can shape and bake. I recommend at least
          3 hours in the refrigerator, but you can also refrigerate it overnight
